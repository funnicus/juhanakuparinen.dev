              <p>
                Hi, my name is <b>Juhana Kuparinen</b>. I was born and
                raised in Helsinki, Finland but as of now
                I study Information and Communcation Technology at University of Turku.
                I'm interested in all things coding, but recently my
                focus has been on fullstack web development with <b>React</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>TypeScript</b> and <b>GraphQL</b>.
                Currently, I'm volunteering at my university student association, Digit ry, as a Webmaster!
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a trackrecord of working well with other people. I have been a Verso-mediator at my
                old school, and I worked as one of the Materials Engineering tutors at University of
                Turku in the fall of 2020. You may be seeing me tutoring again next fall...
              </p>
              <p>
                On my free time, I like to motorcycle, play video games, run/workout and make tasty pizzas.
                I also listen music alot, mainly electronic and ambient. Some of my favorites are <b>Boards of Canada</b>,
                <b> Urlich Schnauss</b>, <b>Aphex Twin</b> and especially the
                album <b>Moon Safari</b> from <b>Air</b>.
