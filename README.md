# Juhana Kuparinen - Developer Website

This is the code for my developer website. It has been build using Gatsby.
I plan to add Contentful headless CMS and a blog system powered with it to this site in the future...

## Developing this site

You need gatsby-cli and node.js

### gatsby develop

Starts development server at https://localhost:8000

### gatsby build

Create production build

### gatsby serve

Serves the production build at https://localhost:9000

### See [here](./GATSBY.md) for more info about a Gatsby site
